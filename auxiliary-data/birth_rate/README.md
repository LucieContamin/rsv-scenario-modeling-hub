### Birth Rate 2016 - 2022 ([birth_rate_2016_2022.txt](./birth_rate_2016_2022.txt))

> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health 
Statistics. National Vital Statistics System, Natality on CDC WONDER Online 
Database. Data are from the Natality Records 2016-2022, as compiled from data 
provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics 
Cooperative Program. Accessed at

Caveats:

1. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant.
2. Birth rates are calculated as the number of births divided by total 
population in the given year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's 
race, mother's hispanicity, location, or year of birth, then the same sub-set 
for age, race, hispanicity, location and year applies to the denominator 
population.
3. Birth rates and fertility rates are calculated using the following 
populations: 
    - The populations for year 2021 are from the postcensal single 
    race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by 
    Census Bureau on June 30, 2022. The 2021 population estimates are based on 
    the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 
    2020 decennial population count. 
    - The populations for year 2020 are from the postcensal single race series 
    of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau 
    on July 27, 2021. 
    - The populations for year 2019 are from the postcensal single race series 
    of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau 
    on June 25, 2020; 
    - The populations for year 2018 are from the postcensal single race series 
    of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau 
    on June 21, 2019; 
    - The populations for year 2017 are from the postcensal single race series 
    of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau 
    on June 21, 2018; 
    - The populations for year 2016 are from the postcensal single race series 
    of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau 
    on June 22, 2017.

1. 'Not Available' appears when the denominator population for a rate 
measure is not available.
2. Each birth record represents one liveborn infant.
3. Birth rates are calculated as the number of births divided by total 
population in the given year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's

## Birth Rate at State Level 1995 - 2022

Using the source files, the birth rate is:
- calculated by state from 1995 to 2015 by dividing the total number of births
by the annual state population * 1000
  - The population information from 1990 to 2000 comes from the US Census 
  Bureau [State and County Intercensal Datasets: 1990-2000](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-1990-2000-state-and-county-characteristics.html)
  - The population information from 2000 to 2010 comes from the US Census 
  Bureau [State Intercensal Datasets: 2000-2010 ](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/intercensal-2000-2010-state.html)
  - The population information from 2010 to 2020 comes from the internal
  [location_census/state_pop_data](./../location_census/state_pop_data.csv) 
  containing the population size per year, state (and national level), age from
  2010 to 2022 (included) from the US Census Bureau. Please see the auxiliary
  [README](./../README.md) for more information.
- standardized from 2016 to 2022
- output with 5 columns:
     - `fips`: fips code of the associated state
     - `year`: year
     - `birth`: number of birth
     - `pop`: population size
     - `birth_rate`: birth / pop * 1000

The output is available in one CSV file:
[birth_rate_1995_2022.csv](./birth_rate_1995_2022.csv).

The code to generate the file is also available in a 
[birth_rate R Script](./birth_rate.R).
