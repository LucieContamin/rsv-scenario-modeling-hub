# RSV Scenario Modeling Hub

## Rationale    

Even the best models of infectious disease transmission struggle to give 
accurate forecasts at time scales greater than 3-4 weeks due to unpredictable 
drivers like changing policy environments, behavior change, development of new 
control measures, and stochastic events. However, policy decisions around the 
course of infectious diseases, particularly emerging and seasonal infections, 
often require projections in the time frame of months. The goal of long-term 
projections is to compare outbreak trajectories under different scenarios, as 
opposed to offering a specific, unconditional estimate of what “will” happen. 
As such, long-term projections can guide longer-term decision-making while 
short-term forecasts are more useful for situational awareness and guiding 
immediate response.

We have specified a set of scenarios and target outcomes to allow alignment of 
model projections for collective insights. Scenarios have been designed in 
consultation with academic modeling teams and government agencies (e.g., CDC).

## How to participate    

The RSV Scenario Modeling Hub is open to any team willing to provide projections
at the right temporal and spatial scales, with minimal gatekeeping. We only 
require that participating teams share point estimates and uncertainty bounds, 
along with a short model description and answers to a list of key questions 
about design. A major output of the projection hub is ensemble estimates of 
epidemic outcomes (e.g., infection, hospitalizations, and deaths), for different
time points, intervention scenarios, and US jurisdictions.

## Auxiliary Data

The repository stores and updates additional data relevant to the RSV modeling 
efforts:

- Population and census data:
    - National and State level name and fips code as used in the Hub and
    associated population size.
    - State level population size per year and per age from the US Census 
    Bureau.

- RSV data:
    - The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS)
    data at national and state level.
    - The [Weekly Rates of Laboratory-Confirmed RSV Hospitalizations from the RSV-NET Surveillance System](https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/Weekly-Rates-of-Laboratory-Confirmed-RSV-Hospitali/29hc-w46k)
    - The [National Emergency Department Visits for COVID-19, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/respiratory-illnesses/index.html)
